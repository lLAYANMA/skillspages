# About Me

Hi there! I'm Layan, a computer engineering student and tech enthusiast.

I created this site to document my journey in learning web development, programming, and open-source contribution.

I love working on personal projects, learning new tools, and sharing what I discover along the way.

Feel free to explore my blog and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!
